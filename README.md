# WFC4All
## Research Goal
The goal of this Master’s Thesis is to design intuitive interaction methods for WFC advanced features. By means of an interactive framework in which artists and designers can very intuitively explore a generative space, by acting either on the input or on ’dials and sliders’ (which steer the advanced algorithm features), we try to fulfill this goal.

## Research Description
Intuitive design means that when a user sees the design, whether it be an application, device, product, et cetera, they know exactly what to do. All apparent interactive tools should work in a way which feels natural and are, hence, not distracted by confusion of what something might do, whilst using it.

Through the development of an application, a test-bench is created to validate the designed intuitive interactive methods for the WFC advanced features. This allows the user to tweak WFC to their requirements without programming. The interaction design will be required to have a high-level of control with an intuitive interface, real-time visual feedback and algorithm responsiveness. How can the usage be generalized, and offered to dummies (i.e. to everyone)? How can those (advanced) features be encapsulated and controlled through e.g. a set of meaningful ’dials and sliders’?
