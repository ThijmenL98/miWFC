# miWFC

[WaveFunctionCollapse](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse) (WFC) is an exciting Procedural Content Generation (PCG) algorithm, but due to lacking intuitive controls, it isn't easily adopted by creative professionals. We investigated how to extend the WFC algorithm to integrate and support a number of interactive methods that more appropriately suit the usual creative workflow of game level designers and artists. Altogether, these methods strongly combine into a so-called mixed-initiative approach, in which the user takes the lead and the generative system extends their work, assisting in the desired direction.

This research resulted in the prototype miWFC (mixed-initiative WFC), that is made available in this repository (both executable and code base). The generative functionality of this prototype system, and its rationale, have been published in [this paper](https://graphics.tudelft.nl/Publications-new/2022/LB22/) at the [2022 PCG Workshop](https://www.pcgworkshop.com/). In addition, many more details of the inner workings of the system can be found in [this MSc thesis](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:b84ed798-5227-476f-870a-72d1645aa759). So if you find miWFC useful for your own research or work, please cite these documents.
