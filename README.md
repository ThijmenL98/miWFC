This project analyses and explores how to adapt the WFC algorithm to support and integrate a number of interactive methods that more appropriately suit the usual creative workflow of game level designers and artists.
Through the development of this application, the designed intuitive interactive methods for the WFC advanced features are accessible for everyone. These allows users to tweak WFC to their requirements without the need for programming.
